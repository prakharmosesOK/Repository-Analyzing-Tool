## üìù Overview

GitHub-Repo-Analyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify the process of understanding and documenting your Git repositories. It offers a suite of features that cater to both individual developers and collaborative teams.

## ‚ú® Features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dependency Analysis:</strong> Identifies all external libraries and frameworks used in your project. This helps understand project requirements and potential compatibility issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Commit History Analysis:</strong> Gain a comprehensive view of your repository's historical changes, including author, date, files changed and commit message. This allows you to track code evolution and identify contributions.</li>
  <li><strong>DocString Generation:</strong> Automatically generate DocStrings within your codebase. DocStrings are comments that explain the functionality of functions, classes, and modules. This improves code readability and maintainability. It automatically creates a pull request to the user's respective project updated with DocStrings.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation Generation (using Sphinx):</strong> Leveraging Sphinx, a popular documentation generation tool, to create comprehensive API documentation from extracted DocStrings. This provides a user-friendly way to understand project functionalities.</li>
</ul>

## üìà Benefits

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Code Understanding:</strong> Sometimes the dependencies used in the project to run are not available and creates a lot of problem. With this, developers can quickly grasp dependencies and focus on main task.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Maintainability:</strong> DocString generation and automatic documentation creation streamline the maintenance process.</li>
  <li><strong>Clearer Contribution Guidelines:</strong> DocStrings provide a clear understanding of existing functions, allowing developers to add their own with proper documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased Readability:</strong> Tool generates a proper html documentation leaveraging Sphinix to increase the readability for general purpose.</li>
</ul>

## üéØ Targeted Users

<ul>
  <li>Individual developers working on personal or small projects.</li>
  <li>Developer teams need to confront a project with least comments or doc strings explaining the project.</li>
  <li>Open-source project maintainers aiming to improve contributor experience.</li>
</ul>

## üì≤ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the GitHub-Repo-Analyzer on your system:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prakharmosesOK/Repository-Analyzing-Tool
    ```

2. Open two terminals, one for frontend and another for backend.

3. In first terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and install all dependencies. Then start the project.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. Create file .env in the root folder of the project and populate it as follows:
   ```env
   GITHUB_NEW_TOKEN = <your-github-token-to-fork-repo>
   GITHUB_PULL_TOKEN = <your-github-token-to-create-pull-request>
   GEMINI_API_KEY = <your-gemini-api-key>
   ```
   Then replace the written username with your GitHub username in line 623 in backend/repoanalyze/views.py.

5. In second terminal, navigate to the backend folder, create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
    ```bash
    python -m venv gitrepoanalyzer
    ```

6. Activate the virtual environmentm install all required dependencies and run the server.
    ```bash
    gitrepoanalyzer\Scripts\activate.ps1
    ```
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

   <strong>Note:</strong>
   <ul>
     <li>The command given above are for windows.</li>
     <li>Don't forget to close the virtual environment before closing the tool as a good   practice. The command for the same is:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```
  </li>
   </ul>

##  üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Usage

The tool basically contains four section:

1. <strong>Dependency Tracker</strong>

   ![image](https://github.com/prakharmosesOK/Repository-Analyzing-Tool/assets/142619454/5c6fb662-1262-40b3-9025-3217086be0f7)

   The use have to enter the Repository link and the branch for which the dependencies are to be fetched.
   By default, tool finds the dependencies of the main branch.

2. <strong>Version Control</strong>

   ![image](https://github.com/prakharmosesOK/Repository-Analyzing-Tool/assets/142619454/69117807-3c17-4026-9fba-c65e81479d04)

   The users are required to enter the repo link in the space provided. It fetches all the commit history and version control for the given repository link.

3. <strong>Comments/DocStrings Generator</strong>

   ![image](https://github.com/prakharmosesOK/Repository-Analyzing-Tool/assets/142619454/3c84e5e3-c4b9-41d7-a3e4-8a92e935c77a)

<ul>
   <li>The user is required to enter the Repository link for which the DocStrings need to be generated.</li>
   <li>Then the tool lists down all the files in the repository, the user has to select for in which file the docstrings should be generated.</li>
   <li>The DocStrings are generated and a pull request is created to the repository which link was provided with a new branch named "GenDocStr".</li>
</ul>

4. <strong>Documentation Generator</strong>

   ![image](https://github.com/prakharmosesOK/Repository-Analyzing-Tool/assets/142619454/467b6968-58a1-434f-9b6f-e9037b258680)

<ul>
   <li>The user has to enter the repository link for which the documentation is to be generated.</li>
   <li>The tool will generate the documentation for those directories only which contain __pycache__ folder. Others will be excluded.</li>
   <li>By default behavior of Sphinix, any function name or class name starting with underscore will not be considered for documentation as it is considered private.</li>
   <li>The documentation.zip can be downloaded from the tool. To open the documentation, open "docs/build/html/index".</li>
</ul>

## ‚öΩ Future Goals

<ol>
  <li>Version Control can be displayed using GUI for better understanding.</li>
  <li>DocString generation can be extended beyond python files.</li>
  <li>Model generated DocStrings can be improved.</li>
</ol>
